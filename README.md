## Pasta e Basta
> Pasta e Basta is an app designed for a chef to construct a menu. The app allows you to create new menu items, where you input the item name, description, price, and type of dish. You can edit and remove menu items as well. 

## Getting Started

>here is the link to the [deployed website](https://pasta-e-basta-e328d7f72cf1.herokuapp.com/) NOTE: The app may be flagged by Chrome as a dangerous website, however the app works on Safari and other browsers. 

>This [link](https://trello.com/invite/b/66995615c13b32b6ccb0b932/ATTI1a22bb7e60b0b5320893569421e388e29F7BEE5C/pasta-e-basta) here takes you to the planning materials for this application. 

## Technologies Used

>THe main technologies used in this application are javascript, node.js, express, mongoose, and mongoDB. 

## Next Steps

> For the next steps, I would like to allow for the chef to be able to click on their dishes, and create recipies. These recipies will be saved in the database, and would be able to be modified or deleted. I would also like to create additional categories of food, as the app only accepts foods that are pastas, pizzas, and desserts.
